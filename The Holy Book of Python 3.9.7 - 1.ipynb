    "The “Python library” contains several different kinds of components. It contains data types that would normally be considered part of the “core” of a language, such as numbers and lists. For these types, the Python language core defines the form of literals and places some constraints on their semantics, but does not fully define the semantics. (On the other hand, the language core does define syntactic properties like the spelling and priorities of operators.) The library also contains built-in functions and exceptions — objects that can be used by all Python code without the need of an import statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The bulk of the library, however, consists of a collection of modules. There are many ways to dissect this collection. Some modules are written in C and built in to the Python interpreter; others are written in Python and imported in source form. Some modules provide interfaces that are highly specific to Python, like printing a stack trace; some provide interfaces that are specific to particular operating systems, such as access to specific hardware; others provide interfaces that are specific to a particular application domain, like the World Wide Web. Some modules are available in all versions and ports of Python; others are only available when the underlying system supports or requires them; yet others are available only when a particular configuration option was chosen at the time when Python was compiled and installed."

    "> Return True if the object argument appears callable, False if not. If this returns True, it is still possible that a call fails, but if it is False, calling object will never succeed. Note that classes are callable (calling a class returns a new instance); instances are callable if their class has a \\_\\_call\\_\\_() method.\n",

    "> Return the string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer i. For example, chr (97) returns the string 'a', while chr (8364) returns the string '€'. This is the inverse of **ord ()**. The valid range for the argument is from 0 through 1,114,111 (0x10FFFF in base 16). ValueError will be raised if i is outside that range.\n",
    "\n",

The instance is ignored except for its class. If a class method is called for a derived class, the derived class object is passed as the implied first argument. Class methods are different than C++ or Java static methods. If you want those, see staticmethod() in this section. For more information on class methods, see types.

This allows objects that implement a custom \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_() or \\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_() function to customize the way dir() reports their attributes. If the object does not provide \\_\\_dir\\_\\_(), the function tries its best to gather information from the object’s \\_\\_dict\\_\\_ attribute, if defined, and from its type object. The resulting list is not necessarily complete, and may be inaccurate when the object has a custom \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_().\n",

For floating point numbers the result is (q, a % b), where q is usually math.floor(a / b) but may be 1 less than that. In any case q * b + a % b is very close to a, if a % b is non-zero it has the same sign as b, and 0 <= abs(a % b) < abs(b).\n",

If function is None, the identity function is assumed, that is, all elements of iterable that are false are removed. Note that filter(function, iterable) is equivalent to the generator expression (item for item in iterable if function(item)) if function is not None and (item for item in iterable if item) if function is None. See itertools.filterfalse() for the complementary function that returns elements of iterable for which function returns false.\n",

If the argument is a string, it should contain a decimal number, optionally preceded by a sign, and optionally embedded in whitespace. The optional sign may be '+' or '-'; a '+' sign has no effect on the value produced. The argument may also be a string representing a NaN (not-a-number), or a positive or negative infinity. More precisely, the input must conform to the following grammar after leading and trailing whitespace characters are removed:\n",

For example, getattr(x, 'foobar') is equivalent to x.foobar. If the named attribute does not exist, default is returned if provided, otherwise AttributeError is raised.

Numeric values that compare equal have the same hash value (even if they are of different types, as is the case for 1 and 1.0). Note: For objects with custom \\_\\_hash\\_\\_() methods, note that hash() truncates the return value based on the bit width of the host machine. See \\_\\_hash\\_\\_() for details.\n",

If the argument is a string, then the string is looked up as the name of a module, function, class, method, keyword, or documentation topic, and a help page is printed on the console. If the argument is any other kind of object, a help page on the object is generated. Note that if a slash(/) appears in the parameter list of a function, when invoking help(), it means that the parameters prior to the slash are positional-only. For more info, see the FAQ entry on positional-only parameters. This function is added to the built-in namespace by the site module.\n",

A class is considered a subclass of itself. classinfo may be a tuple of class objects, in which case return True if class is a subclass of any entry in classinfo. In any other case, a TypeError exception is raised.\n",

Without a second argument, object must be a collection object which supports the iteration protocol (the \\_\\_iter\\_\\_() method), or it must support the sequence protocol (the \\_\\_getitem\\_\\_() method with integer arguments starting at 0). If it does not support either of those protocols, TypeError is raised. If the second argument, sentinel, is given, then object must be a callable object. The iterator created in this case will call object with no arguments for each call to its \\_\\_next\\_\\_() method; if the value returned is equal to sentinel, StopIteration will be raised, otherwise the value will be returned. See also Iterator Types.\n",

Static methods in Python are similar to those found in Java or C++. Also see classmethod() for a variant that is useful for creating alternate class constructors. Like all decorators, it is also possible to call staticmethod as a regular function and do something with its result. This is needed in some cases where you need a reference to a function from a class body and you want to avoid the automatic transformation to instance method. For these cases, use this idiom:\n",

For some use cases, there are good alternatives to sum(). The preferred, fast way to concatenate a sequence of strings is by calling ''.join(sequence). To add floating point values with extended precision, see math.fsum(). To concatenate a series of iterables, consider using itertools.chain().

Direct use of \\_\\_import\\_\\_() is also discouraged in favor of importlib.import_module(). The function imports the module name, potentially using the given globals and locals to determine how to interpret the name in a package context. The fromlist gives the names of objects or submodules that should be imported from the module given by name. The standard implementation does not use its locals argument at all, and uses its globals only to determine the package context of the import statement. level specifies whether to use absolute or relative imports. 0 (the default) means only perform absolute imports. Positive values for level indicate the number of parent directories to search relative to the directory of the module calling \\_\\_import\\_\\_() (see PEP 328 for the details). When the name variable is of the form package.module, normally, the top-level package (the name up till the first dot) is returned, not the module named by name. However, when a non-empty fromlist argument is given, the module named by name is returned."
